## Example Voting App Kubernetes

This is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) repository from the [docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples) GitHub page

and modified it to work on the Kubernetes cluster.

Rewriting to work on K8s was done here: https://github.com/kodekloudhub/example-voting-app-kubernetes
I have added ingress configuration to work on Rancher Desktop with Traefik as ingress controller.
